### Creating accounts

First, create an admin account by running:

`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`

Then, run the server and login to [127.0.0.1:8000/admin](127.0.0.1:8000/admin)

Use the add buttons to add the following groups:
* `admin`
* `prof`
* `student`

As of April 5, I don't think that permissions need to be added to any of these groups. The names are the important part.

Users can now be added and assigned to each group.
